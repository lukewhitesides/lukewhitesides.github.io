  My name is Luke. I am an experienced product manager based in the San Francisco bay area with expertise in building products and technology powered by AI and IoT and integrating them with digital platforms and user experiences to solve customer and user problems.

  My professional accomplishments include the successful launch of several healthcare IoT and digital products that achieved both profitability, double digit CAGR, and positive customer ROI in an economically challenging and complex industry. 

  I am interested in applying my skills to net zero climate goals, circular economy, decarbonization and renewable energy transition for digital products.
