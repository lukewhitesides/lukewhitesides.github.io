---

  My name is Luke. I am an experienced product manager with expertise in building products and technology powered by AI and IoT and integrating them with digital platforms and user experiences to solve customer and user problems.

  My professional accomplishments include the successful launch of several healthcare IoT and digital products that achieved both profitability, double digit CAGR, and positive customer ROI in an economically challenging and complex industry. 

  I am interested in applying my skills to net zero climate goals, circular economy, decarbonization and renewable energy transition for digital products.

  I live in South Lake Tahoe, CA and spend a lot of time in the San Francisco Bay area as well. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, skiing, trail running, and hanging out with my cat, Freya.
