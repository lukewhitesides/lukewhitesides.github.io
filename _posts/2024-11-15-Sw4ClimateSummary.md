A few months ago, I enrolled in Terra.do’s online course, Software for Climate, driven by a mix of personal and professional motivations. As someone fascinated by decarbonization and climate solutions—and with over a decade of experience in software development—I saw this course as an ideal opportunity to explore these topics. I was also curious about the overlap between the healthcare industry, where I’ve worked, and other sectors. Additionally, the course’s hands-on coding assignments offered a chance to refresh my technical skills and learn new tools.

The course featured five modules and a final project. Each module included a lecture, a coding assignment, and peer review sessions. Topics ranged from using public APIs to analyze energy data and emissions, to GIS and AI applications for land classification, solar energy modeling, and IoT sensors for tracking air quality and weather. The peer reviews were especially valuable for learning from and connecting with the cohort.

For my final project, I combined insights from the GIS/AI and photovoltaic modules to create a solar site selection tool. This prototype identified suitable land for solar projects using data analysis and modeling. The project was both challenging and rewarding, pushing me to apply and deepen my skills. I especially enjoyed learning and using the Google Earth Engine APIs. During the course’s final presentations, my project was honored with superlatives for Best Overall, Most Inspiring, and Best Execution—a humbling and motivating experience. There is a full write-up about my final project in [this post](https://lukewhitesides.github.io/2024-11-28-ASLA-v1/)

#### Key Takeaways
* Tools like Hex notebooks and ChatGPT have made creating software prototypes vastly more efficient.
* There’s an abundance of publicly accessible climate-related data waiting to be leveraged.
* Skills from other industries—like healthcare—translate well to climate-focused initiatives.
* The climate tech community is vibrant and supportive, but engaging with it requires initiative.

Overall, the course was an enriching experience, blending technical challenges with community inspiration. It deepened my understanding of how software can drive climate solutions and gave me a clearer path to contribute.
