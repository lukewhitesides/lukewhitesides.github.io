title: Automated Solar Land Search
subtitle: Using GIS, AI land classification, and PV modeling to identify new sites for solar development

  I’ve recently been working on a project that is intended to streamline the development of new solar projects by identifying parcels of land that would be suitable to host a new community or utility scale solar site. The first step was to identify what some of the criteria are that would make a given piece of land suitable for a solar array. Doing some basic research on the internet I learned a few things about the site selection criteria new solar developer would go through:

#### Land Area Requirements
* Utility-scale solar farms typically require at least 30 acres of land
* Community solar projects can be built on smaller parcels of 5-10 acres
* Generally, each 1 MW of solar capacity needs about .01 square km of land
  
#### Topography and Land Characteristics
* Flat or gently sloping land is preferred
* Land should be free from exclusion zones like flood plains, wetlands, protected habitats, etc.
* Cleared land without many trees or structures is more attractive
  
#### Proximity to Infrastructure
* Land within 4 miles of an electrical substation is ideal
* Proximity to transmission lines (within 1 mile) is important
* Access to roads for construction and maintenance is considered
  
#### Solar Resource
* Adequate sunlight is necessary, though less critical than other factors

  Based on these criteria, I hypothesized it would be possible to create a software program that uses GIS data and AI based land classification, along with some other public data sets, to identify plots of land in which a solar farm of a specified MW capacity could be developed. I decided to codename this project ASLA, an acronym for Automated Solar Landa Assessment. I identified the following requirements for MVP/prototype level software. 
* Accept the desired MW capacity and GPS coordinates of the search range as inputs
* Convert the MW capacity square km needed for land based of a simple conversion factor
* For the search range, iterate over the entire range checking each plot equal to the square km needed
* For each plot
* * Use GIS and AI based land classification to determine what the land is being used for. For example, land can be classified as forest, bare, grass, crops, snow/ice, etc.
* * Check that the maximum slope of the land is less than 5 degrees; plots exceeding the max slope will be filtered out
* * Check that there are not roads on the land
* * Save the top five plots based on the percentage of land use that is classified to be acceptable for solar use. Land that was classified as bare, shrub and scrub, grass, and crops were deemed to be acceptable use for solar development.
* For each of the top five plots, a solar modeling assessment using historic weather data was completed to validate the average and max megawatt capacity for a hypothetical solar array on the plot
* * Produce a map identifying the location of each of the plots
* * Produce a written summary showing the coordinates of each plot, land use, and solar modeling output

  I have not done much coding recently and am new to Python, but thanks to ChatGPT and many of the Python libraries out there I was able to create software capable of the above requirements with about 15-20 hours of work. Another big help was some example code I had access to through the Terra.do Software for Climate course (more on this in another post). This was super helpful for learning how to use Google Earth Engine Dynamic World for land classification and the pvlib for solar modeling.

  Overall, I was pretty happy with the result ASLA was able to provide. Generally, it is able to search over a range the size of a typical county in about 10 minutes and for the most part provide logical results. Adding the check that there are no roads in the plot was a feature I added after testing it and seeing some plots show up with a major road going down the middle. In the future, I’d like to make it capable of detecting if there is a road near the plot, but not in the plot. Some other features I have ideas for already is trying to prioritize land near a grid interconnection point with available capacity, and taking in the ownership and land value into account when prioritizing the top 5 plots. My next steps are to try to find some solar developers to interview to get some preliminary feedback on the value of ASLA or a tool like it and to see what other features would be useful. I am excited to learn more about this space and see where I can continue work in this space!
